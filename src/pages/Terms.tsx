        <Section title="4. Anonymity is not a shield">
          <p>
            The platform is anonymous to other users, but your account is tied to your university email.
            If we receive a valid legal order (court subpoena, law-enforcement request under Greek/EU law),
            or if content endangers life, we may be required to disclose account information to the
            relevant authority. Don&apos;t commit crimes here.

        <Section title="6. Paid promotions">
          <p>

            royalty-free license to host, display, and distribute your content within the platform for
            the sole purpose of running the service. You are solely responsible for the legality of your
            content.

            The service is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without warranties of any kind. The operator is
            not liable for user-generated content, downtime, data loss, or any indirect damages, to the
